      <description>After learning about spearfishing I signed up for the nearest freediving course I could find. Since then, freediving and breath holding has become a passion that I continue to explore daily and share with others. Freediving has allowed me to explore not only the ocean but also myself and what I&#39;m capable of.
With a background of over 5 years in outdoor education Iâ€™ve developed an approach to teaching that focuses on the individual, helping you master one skill at a time before moving to the next.</description>
