After learning about spearfishing I signed up for the nearest freediving course I could find. Since then, **freediving** and breath holding has become a **passion that I continue to explore daily** and share with others. Freediving has allowed me to explore not only the ocean but also myself and what I'm capable of.

With a background of **over 5 years in outdoor education** I’ve developed an approach to **teaching that focuses on the individual**, helping you master one skill at a time before moving to the next.

Over the last few years I’ve been helping **grow the freediving community in California** and traveling around the world to learn from the deepest freedivers.

Whether you want to start **spearfishing**, **recreational freediving**, or just want to be more **confident in the water** I’m here to **support and guide you in your journey**.
